## Homework 5

### Setup

This should be no different than the libraries needed for Homework 4. But in case you need to re-install, follow these steps.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install pycryptodome
```

### Question 9

You will use the code [here](./homework5/generate_keys.py)

### Question 10

You will use the code [here](./homework5/rsa_decrypt.py). You will need to add the hex string of ciphertext from the homework assignment.
